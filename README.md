## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Alright this time I've become a lot more comfortable with using CSS Flexbox properties. I was able to center all the contents the way I wanted it to without having to watch any YouTube videos regarding CSS Flexbox. Other than that, there wasn't anything new that I got to experience as the methodologies involved in this solution is very similar to my previous blog-preview-card solution. 

### Continued development

Although I feel like I was able to use my div elements wisely to place the content in appropriate places, I believe that my CSS styling could still be shortened and improved in some areas. For example, I didn't really make use of the font size 14 and instead used <h> and <p> and then styled them separately, often multiple times to achieve the desired effect. 

### Useful resources

- YouTube
